this version has been modified to more closely suit Wymac core game team style.

todo :
1. for methods starting with `On`, `void OnWordWord()` generate `/// Handles word word.`
2. for methods with single words `void Word()` generate `/// Performs word.` (potential convert to noun(?) "Dispose" to "Disposal")
3. optional no params mode, saved per solution.
4. execute for entire file at once.
